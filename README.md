Architecture for Data Flow:

    Frontend (Electron + React):
        Connection to WebSocket: Establish one or more WebSocket connections to the backend.
        Waiting for Updates: The frontend essentially acts as a display manager. It listens for events like new_slide, highlight_key_point, or show_summary.
        UI Updates: On receiving an update from the backend, the frontend updates the presentation view accordingly.

    Backend (Python Flask + WebSocket Server):
        Audio Recording and Processing:
            Record audio and process it directly on the backend. This ensures that the model always has access to the audio stream without dependency on the userâ€™s device capabilities.
            Handle model inference using ML models (e.g., transcribing the audio, summarizing it, extracting key points).
        WebSocket Communication:
            Emit events to the frontend when new information is generated, such as when a specific keyword is detected or a new segment of the summary is ready.
        Multiple WebSocket Channels (Events):
            You can use different channels (e.g., slide_update, summary_update, key_point_update) to emit information to the frontend.
            This ensures that the frontend can selectively update different components of the presentation interface depending on what type of data is received.
